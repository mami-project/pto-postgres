              <span class="txt-small">Given the increasing deployment of middleboxes in the Internet, we see an ossification of the protocol stack that makes it difficult to deploy new protocols or protocol extensions. The data provided by this observatory assists to quantify impairments on path transparency when traffic is altered or treated differently on a network path based on the protocol stack in use.</span>

              <span class="txt-small">The <i>Path Transparency Observatory</i> (PTO) collects measurement data from different sources and generated by different measurements tools. An data-format-specific, intermediate processing step generates <i>observations</i> of a network <i>condition <b>c</b></i> on a <i>path <b>p</b></i> during a <i>time interval <b>t</b></i>. 
              <br><br>
              We provide the <a href="papi.html"><span class="txt-abbr">P</span>ath Transparency Observatory-<span class="txt-abbr">API</span> (PAPI)</a> to run custom queries on observation data base of the PTO.

              <span class="txt-small">Currently the PTO only host observation on impairments for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), an IP/TCP extension for congestion signaling instead of drop. Despite initial deployment problems blocking ECN usage, we have measurement increasing support of ECN by webservers and Apple announced in April 2016 that iOS and macOS devices will probabilistic attempts to negotiate ECN by default on the client side. 
              <br><br>
              The PTO provides access to our latest measurement data that complements a series of measurement started in 2014. Older data as well as measurement data exposing impairments on other protocols and protocol extension are currently in processing and will be successively added to the PTO over the next couple of month. Stay tuned!</span>
